## Usage

### Restoring the Database from Backup

To set up the database required for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Database Backup File**:
   - Download the `Learning_1.bak` file from the [Library-Management-System-ASP.NET](https://github.com/SyedHuzaifa417/Library-Management-System-ASP.NET-).

2. **Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**:
   - Launch SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance.

3. **Restore the Database**:
   - Right-click on the `Databases` node in Object Explorer.
   - Select `Restore Database...`.

4. **Restore Database Wizard**:
   - In the `Source` section, select `Device` and click the `...` button.
   - Click `Add` and navigate to the location where you downloaded the `Learning_1.bak` file. Select the file and click `OK`.
   - In the `Destination` section, ensure that the `Database` field is set to `Learning_1` (or your preferred name for the restored database).

5. **Restore Options**:
   - Under the `Options` page, select `Overwrite the existing database (WITH REPLACE)` if you are restoring over an existing database.
   - Ensure other options are set as needed for your environment.

6. **Execute Restore**:
   - Click `OK` to begin the restore process.
   - Once the process completes, you will receive a confirmation message.

Your database is now restored and ready for use with the Library Management System project. Ensure your connection string in `web.config` is configured to connect to this restored database.

### Running the Application

1. **Update Connection String**:
   - Open the `web.config` file and update the connection string to point to your SQL Server instance where the database has been restored.

2. **Build and Run**:
   - Open the project in Visual Studio.
   - Build the solution to restore the necessary packages and compile the project.
   - Run the project using IIS Express or your preferred web server.

Visit `http://localhost:port` in your browser to access the application.
